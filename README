Tower Defense Game

COMPILING
=========
On Mac and Linux, run the deps script to install all dependencies.
Then run qmake and make to build the tower defense game.
    $ ./tools/deps.sh
    $ qmake
    $ make


On Windows, with Visual Studio 2010:
------------------------------------
From the command-line (a bash shell is preferable):
    cd ./3rdParty/libtiled
    qmake -spec win32-msvc2008 -tp vc
    cd ../../src
    qmake -spec win32-msvc2008 -tp vc server.pro
    qmake -spec win32-msvc2008 -tp vc client.pro
    cd ..
    qmake -spec win32-msvc2008 -tp vc

Open the resulting td.sln file in Visual Studio (going
through the conversion wizard).
Fiddle with all of the VS project settings to make it find the
libraries.
